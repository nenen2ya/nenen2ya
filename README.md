# 👋 Hi, I'm Han Hyunbibi!

I'm currently a **third-year Computer Science student at Kyung Hee University**, with a strong interest in building real-world applications that solve practical problems.  
I enjoy working on projects that blend **clean architecture, user experience, and real functionality** — and I’m always eager to learn and grow as a developer.
